# Snakes-and-Ladders
A simple implementation of Snakes and Ladders in Python

● There are 6 face dice which are being rolled by the player to their
chance.
● The player starts from 0 and has to reach the final position (in our case,
  it's 100).
● There are some ladders which turn out to be lucky for the player as
  they shorten the way.
● There are some snakes present in between the game which turns out
  to be the enemy of the player as they just lengthen their way to 100.
● The position of snakes and ladders are stored in start:end format
  where start denotes the position of ladder/snake and end denotes the
  value that it reaches.
  
Position of snakes: {17 : 7, 54 : 34, 62 : 19, 98 : 79}
Position of ladders: {3 : 38, 24 : 33, 42 : 93, 72 : 84}
