● There are 6 face dice which are being rolled by the player to their chance.
● The player starts from 0 and has to reach the final position (in our case, it's 100).
● There are some ladders which turn out to be lucky for the player as they shorten the way.
● There are some snakes present in between the game which turns out to be the enemy of the player as they just lengthen their way to 100.
● The position of snakes and ladders are stored in start:end format where start denotes the position of ladder/snake and end denotes the value that it reaches.

Position of snakes: {17 : 7, 54 : 34, 62 : 19, 98 : 79}
Position of ladders: {3 : 38, 24 : 33, 42 : 93, 72 : 84}

# Structure:
● The game will only be text output based, i.e. no GUI will be shown to the user. Instead, it will use print statements to display the position of a particular player, 
  end results etc.
● There are only 2 players in the game and no spectators are allowed.
● The first thing that the game will ask to input will be names of the players.
    The input should first ask the name of Player 1 and then after giving input,
    it should ask the name of Player 2.
● The game will alternate between these 2 players.
    For a particular player’s chance, it will ask to input his/her chance. If Player1 enters “ roll ”, then a random number will be generated between 1 and 6 (both inclusive).
    The output will be shown and then the final position will be displayed each time a player plays his/her chance.

The game consists of 2 modes: Auto mode and manual mode. 
  For auto mode, a player will type roll and a random number will be generated imitating the roll of dice. 
  For a manual mode, instead of entering roll, players can enter any number between 1 and 20 and that particular number will imitate that throw.

During any player’s chance, if he/she enters “quit” (without quotes), then the game will instantaneously end for that particular player and the other player will win the game.
